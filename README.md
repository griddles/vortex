# Vortex Video Public Repo

---

Vortex aims to be a video sharing platform in competition with Youtube, but with much better policies and services.   
Some of these include:   
 - A non intrusive algorithm   
 - Much more power given to creators over things like ads   
 - A much looser content guideline system that still blocks actually harmful content, not "guns with magazines of over 10 rounds" like Youtube   
 - A system in which all users are notified of changes at least a week before they release, and creators are given a vote on whether the change should be kept, modified, or discarded, both before and after the change is released. Obviously this wouldn't apply to some changes, like stuff having to do with the backend stuff or other very important changes.   
 - a considerably better policy regarding copyright claims, that doesn't allow anyone to steal money from content creators for no reason.   

this is obviously super ambitious and unlikely to actually get to a place where it can legitimately compete with a company as big as Google, however if nobody tries nobody will succeed.

### How to get involved

Join the Vortex Development Discord at https://discord.gg/5zWxzwAukj and send a message in the #applications channel with your qualifications, why you want to help out, etc. If I think you're a good fit, I'll add you to the team.   
Currently I have no funding for this, but if I can get enough support hopefully I'll be able to turn this into a real company and start hiring actual developers, maybe even some of you guys if you're up for that.   

We currently need (in order of importance):

 - HTML/CSS/PHP/JS devs, to make the core of the website
 - someone who can write some backend code, like stuff to handle the video uploading process and also the algorithm, preferably in something like c# but if you know a language that is 1: somewhat commonly used 2: relatively easy to learn and use and 3: more efficient than c# then that would work too
 - someone who knows how to write SQL and use mySQL databases, or something similar but better
 - someone who can handle server hosting stuff so we can actually make this a website

you dont necessarily have to fit exactly to these, if you know more about web design/database stuff/server hosting than me (you probably do) and there's a different/better way to do all this then just hop in the discord and tell me.

### Who am I?

I'm currently taking college level classes in various different programming languages, including HTML/CSS. I'm sick of Youtube getting away with everything because they're the only good video platform, so I wanna change that.   

Obviously I'm pretty underqualified for something of this scale at the moment, but I'm trying to learn as fast as I can. Most of my code is gonna be super inefficient and garbage since I literally started HTML/CSS/PHP/JS last week, so if you see anything problematic just let me know and give me a way to fix it and I'll make it better.   

Also, as a bunch of different people I've met have said, "An employer is hiring you to do something better than they can." It's a little different since I wouldn't be exactly hiring you, but you get the point. You'll probably be way better than me at whatever you join the team to do, which is why I want you to join the team.   

If you want an idea of what my work looks like, just check out some of the other stuff I've uploaded to github.

### FAQ:

**Where's the actual code?**   
This repo is just the public side of Vortex, since Github Repos are free and easy to use. The actual code is in a private repo, since ideally this will turn into an actual buisness, and having the entire source code public is not exactly a good idea, since nothing would be stopping anyone else from just yoinking the code and completely screwing me over.   

**Well then how can I see where the website is at currently?**   
This page will be updated with screenshots whenever a working build is ready.   

**I wanna help out, but I don't know how to program stuff!**   
Eventually I'll set up a patreon so that I can get some funding, but at the moment the project is too small for something like that. However, you can help by spreading the word! Tell your programmer friends, send it in programming discords (with permission of course), get the word out! The more people I have to help, the faster it'll go.   

**I wanna help out, but I only know [insert not-relevant language here]!**   
Learn a new language! I've learned about 6 different languages to some degree of skill in about 5 months, without even trying that hard. You can check the section above for which language would be most helpful, or just pick one you like.   

**Why are you doing this? There's no way you can compete with Google.**   
That sounds like quitter talk. Nobody will ever compete with Google if nobody tries to compete with Google. Plus, with enough community support we can do anything we want, as demonstrated by the reddit/gamestop incident in 2021. My motivation for this is that YouTube has given thousands of great people a job in entertaining others, but refuses to treat these people like people. With every change, it gets harder and harder for many content creators to keep making enough money to stay full-time, and thats no good. In addition, with the removal of the dislike button, the addition of ridiculous amounts of ads, and the censorship of anything youtube dislikes, the experience for the average viewer has been steadily declining.
